Allyson Hobbs,yes,Spatial History Project,"Allyson Hobbs is an assistant professor of American and African American history at Stanford. Currently, she is at work on a book manuscript that examines the phenomenon of racial passing in the United States from the late eighteenth century to the present. Allyson’s book is tentatively titled A Chosen Exile: A History of Racial Passing in American Life. The focus of her second book project will be migration, a different form of “crossing over” than passing and a major theme in African American and American history. The Great Migration was a watershed in African American life: over the course of six decades (1910-1970), six million black southerners left the South in search of more meaningful experiences of freedom. She hopes to offer a different angle of vision on the migration by bringing to light the places where migrants slept, ate, got haircuts, and danced along the way. She plans to recreate their routes, keeping the following questions in mind: how did the experience of migrating create, nurture, and solidify African American identities? What fractures, contradictions, and tensions within African American identities did the migration bring into relief? What kinds of resources did African Americans draw upon to navigate the constraints of Jim Crow America on the road?","Faculty Researcher, Spatial History Project",History,History,Allyson,Assistant Professor of History,,Hobbs,,faculty researcher,,Stanford

Stace Maples,yes,Spatial History Project,"As the Geospatial Manager at The Stanford Geospatial Center I provide support and collaboration to the Stanford research community in capturing and making sense of the “where” of their work. My work mapping the research interests of scholars has taken me from the beaches of Martha’s Vineyard, to Kurdish Northeastern Syria, to the most remote areas of the Mongolian/Chinese border. An archaeologist by training and a technologist by temperament, I am interested in all aspects of mapping, from the aerial imaging of archaeological sites using kites and balloons, to the development of platforms for the gathering of volunteer geographic information. I have over 18 years of experience using Geographic Information Systems and Geotechnology for research and teaching, with expertise in a broad range of geospatial and supporting software and hardware.","Geospatial Manager, Earth Sciences Library",Earth Sciences Library,,Maples,Geospatial Manager,,Stace,,affiliate,,Stanford
