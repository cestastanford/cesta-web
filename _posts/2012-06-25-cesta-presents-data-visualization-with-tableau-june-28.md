CESTA will supplement its busy summer season with an ongoing series of talks and mini-workshops called CESTA Presents. Each week, we&#8217;ll feature presentations by members and friends of the CESTA community. These presentations will vary in content and format, and are meant mainly as a somewhat informal exchange of information, ideas, and feedback for all lab participants, regardless of individual lab or project affiliation.

Some of the presentations will be more technical in nature, concentrating more on particular software, methods, etc., whereas other presentations will take the form of informal discussions about someone&#8217;s research. All members of the CESTA community are encouraged to attend these valuable discussions.

Our first presentation takes place this Thursday!

**Data Visualization with Tableau**  
**Ryan Heuser, Literary Lab, CESTA**  
**Thursday, June 28th @ Noon**  
**Grand Central Room, 4th Floor Wallenberg Hall**

Stairwell doors will be unlocked for this event for those who do not have access cards.
