Greetings everyone! We would like to officially welcome you to the new CESTA blog. This will be our new common web presence for all things CESTA. The individual labs will of course continue to maintain their own unique websites (see links on the main sidebar), but this will be the venue where we share any common information that relates to CESTA as a whole.

We will also communicate with everyone within the CESTA community via a mailing list, so be on the lookout for that as well. That mailing list and this blog are meant to work hand in hand in improving and streamlining communication among the three labs.

We&#8217;ll continue to update, expand, and tweak the site as we go, and we welcome any comments, suggestions, or questions regarding this blog or the mailing list.
