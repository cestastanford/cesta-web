Greetings All,

Elijah Meeks from Stanford will be giving a Gephi workshop at UC Berkeley this week, please see details below.

\***\***\***\***\****

Dear friends,

We are pleased to be hosting a summer workshop introducing <a href="http://gephi.org/" target="_blank">Gephi</a>, an open source spatial analysis and network visualization software, with Elijah Meeks, the Digital Humanities Specialist at Stanford University.  See <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Wo22jl4Ac&feature=player_embedded" target="_blank">this video</a> for an example of Gephi being used to track how Wikipedia was edited during the recent revolutions in the Arab World.

The Gephi workshop will be Wednesday, July 11, from 1pm to 4pm in 124 Mulford Hall. If you are interested in attending the workshop, please write to <a href="mailto:dhc-history@berkeley.edu" target="_blank">dhc-history@berkeley.edu</a>.
Sincerely,
Chris Church
