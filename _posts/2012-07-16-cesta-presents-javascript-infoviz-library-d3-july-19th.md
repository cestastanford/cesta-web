**Javascript InfoViz Library 3D  
**

D3 is a JavaScript information visualization library that relies on scalable vector graphics (SVG) to display interactive and dynamic content. D3 is a robust framework that not only allows for traditional plots of categorical and quantitative information, but also the display of geospatial and network data. This presentation will touch on the data formats commonly used for D3 such as JSON and GeoJSON, the general structure of how D3 processes data and interaction events, performance and compatibility issues, and resources to learn D3.

The following sites provide an overview of D3, as well as examples and tutorials:
