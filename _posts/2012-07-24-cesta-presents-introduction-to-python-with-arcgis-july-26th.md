&#8220;Python is an easy to learn, powerful language&#8230; (with) high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python&#8217;s elegant syntax and dynamic typing&#8230;make it an ideal language for scripting&#8230;in many areas and on many platforms.&#8221; -<a href="http://python.org" target="_blank">python.org</a>
