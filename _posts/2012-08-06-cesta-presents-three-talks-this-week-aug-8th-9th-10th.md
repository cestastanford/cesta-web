We encourage everyone to attend this week&#8217;s series of *CESTA Presents* talks, and we have three back-to-back this time around:

**Publishing Interactive Scholarly Works: The Case of ORBIS**  
**Karl Grossner, Digital Humanities Developer, Stanford Libraries**  
**Wednesday, August 8th**  
**Grand Central, Fourth Floor of Wallenberg Hall (Building 160)**

The results of scholarly research are normally shared in oral presentations and in written works—for example books and peer-reviewed journals. These are most often accompanied by static images, including charts, graphs, photos, diagrams and maps. As humanities scholars increasingly use digitally enabled methods, and more software tools become generally available, there is a growing impetus to publish data. And there is a corresponding opportunity to publish web-based software applications that present scholarly argumentation and provide interactive access to authors’ computational models and the supporting data. It is fair to say that a genre of ***interactive scholarly works ***is emerging, and the recent project, <a href="http://orbis.stanford.edu/" target="_blank"><em>ORBIS: The Stanford Geospatial Network Model of the Roman World</em></a> is an example.[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-155" title="karl1" src="https://cesta.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/karl11.png" alt="" width="900" height="679" />][1]I will present technical details behind the ORBIS site, including the data model and the open-source mapping technologies used in its digital representation and web presentation. I’ll show how its interactive elements permit users to actively engage with the data and the author’s arguments. Finally I will discuss our work-in-progress to share both the data and underlying models with a global scholarly community—in an application programming interface (API) for programmatic access, and the publication in RDF format as Linked Data.

**Geographies of the Holocaust**  
**Tim Cole, Professor of Social History at the University of Bristol, UK**  
**Thursday, August 9th at Noon**  
**Grand Central, Fourth Floor of Wallenberg Hall (Building 160)**

Professor Cole will discuss the work of an international interdisciplinary team of scholars who have been exploring the potential of GIScience, cartography and geo-visualization to uncover spatial patterns during the Holocaust.

**Mapping Vice in Early Twentieth-Century Philadelphia**  
**Michael Kahan, Associate Director of H&S Programs, Stanford**  
**Friday, August 10th at Noon**  
**Grand Central, Fourth Floor of Wallenberg Hall (Building 160)**  
****  
This work has been developed in conjunction with the Spatial History Project.  Michael will speak briefly about the process of publishing it as part of a journal article, and he&#8217;ll be especially interested to hear your thoughts about possible next steps for this research and the visualization.
