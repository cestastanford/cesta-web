Early Modern Time & Networks is a humanities + design collaboration to create tools for humanities research defined by humanities research questions and involving humanities scholars in the design and development process. For the design research and computer science participants we hope to demystify humanities research. For the humanities scholars we hope to demystify the engineering of computational data visualization tools.

The two-week intensive workshop builds upon previous [Mapping the Republic of Letters][1] collaborations between the SHC Research Lab, [DensityDesign Research Lab][2], and Sebastien Heymann ([Gephi][3]). Together we have been exploring the exchange of ideas and the interactions of individuals through the visualization and contextualization of heterogeneous, multi-dimensional data sets derived from narrative sources.

We have been developing a web-based interactive visual display for investigating temporal-spatial-relational dynamics in human networks. During the workshop we will put this prototype tool to the test with five case studies, each one bringing unique source materials and specific research questions.

The workshop will meet at Stanford University&#8217;s [Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis (CESTA)][4] on the 4th floor of Wallenberg Hall and at the [Stanford Humanities Center][5].</section>
