The GIS Forma Urbis Romae Project: Creating a Layered History of Rome seeks to reveal and analyze a 2000-year urban spatial history. The subject of our inquiry is Rome, and the object of our investigation is the cartographic masterpiece and pioneering study of ancient Roman topography, Forma Urbis Romae.  Published in 1901 by the Italian archeologist, Rodolfo Lanciani (1845 – 1929) this map sums up the rich cartographic tradition to be found for Rome. Today it remains the standard archeological reference for the city even though it does not incorporate the host of archeological discoveries that have come to light since its original publication.  Our objective is to republish a new Forma Urbis Romae as an interactive and dynamically evolving spatial database that will document and represent the archeological foundations of the city and their subsequent manifestations in later epochs.  In addition to an interactive digital product, we are planning print versions of the map through periodic releases, or a print-on-demand feature, to record important milestones in the ongoing investigation.

In this presentation I share the landscape photography of Henry G. Peabody, who between the 1880s and 1940s traveled extensively throughout North America producing images for various publishing companies, and for his own educational slideshows.  I am attempting to  
recreate two of his narrated slideshows that focus on Zion and Grand Canyon National Parks with materials from the Huntington Library archive.  My hope is to design online experiences of these slideshows from viewpoints of the photographer, the historical geographer situated in 2012, and the spatially-minded artist who is able to take liberties with the images and their original appended textual meanings.

Doors and elevator will be unlocked for these events. Please contact Matt Bryant if you have any questions 650-721-1385, or mpbryant@stanford.edu
