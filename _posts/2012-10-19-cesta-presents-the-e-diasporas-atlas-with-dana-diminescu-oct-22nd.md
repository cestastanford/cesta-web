**Dana Diminescu, The e-Diasporas Atlas**

Monday, October 22, 3:00 p.m.  
Wallenberg Hall, 4th Floor, Gold & Honey

The e-Diasporas Atlas was incubated and developed in the framework of the Fondation Maison des Sciences de l’Homme ICT Migrations program. Initiated and coordinated by Dana Diminescu, the project introduced digital methods into research on diasporas. This was made possible by the R&D innovations of Mathieu Jacomy and thanks to the technical coordination and training provided by Matthieu Renault. Some eighty researchers from diverse disciplines, laboratories and countries took part in the project. Several partners also contributed to its success: the Institut National de l&#8217;Audiovisuel, the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique through its Migrinter laboratory, the Institut Mines-Telecom, Linkfluence and the design studio Incandescence. The e-Diasporas Atlas received funding from the Agence National de la Recherche (STIC Content and Interaction), the École d&#8217;ingénieurs Telecom ParisTech and the Fondation Maison des Sciences de l’Homme Paris.

Dana Diminescu, a practicing sociologist, is an associate professor at TelecomParisTech. Her empirical work has enabled her to approach a variety of fields: e.g. uses of mobile telephone and voice IT, the Internet (tailing, archiving, mapping of the Web), and identifying digitalization technologies and m-transactions by migrants. Since 2003 she has been the scientific director of the research program ICT Migrations at the Fondation Maison des Sciences de l’Homme, Paris. This program, which she launched ten years ago, has made major contributions to the theorization and analysis of the “connected migrant”.
