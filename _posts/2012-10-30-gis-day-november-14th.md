Greetings,

On behalf of the GIS Lab staff at Branner Earth Sciences Library, we would like to invite you to attend our annual GIS Day at Branner. The event will take place in** Hartley Conference Center**, just downstairs from Branner, on Wednesday November 14th from 2pm to 5:00pm. The goal for this day is to celebrate the rich variety of projects happening at Stanford, as well as to connect different groups and inspire students and faculty with the possibilities of using GIS in their research.

The style for GIS Day is an Open House with lightning talks (5min per speaker) and a map gallery where students and departments bring posters of their projects. This would involve a minimal time commitment (10 min max), yielding a great deal of publicity for your work. GIS Day can also serve as a platform to showcase the awesome work that has come out of the Spatial History Lab. It will be a great way for people to hear about the Spatial History Lab as well as what we do there. An overview of our event last year is accessible at: <a href="http://lib.stanford.edu/gis-branner-library/gis-day-2011-november-16th" target="_blank">http://lib.stanford.edu/gis-<wbr>branner-library/gis-day-2011-<wbr>november-16th</wbr></wbr></a>. There will be food and beverages, contests, prizes, and a table for children, so bring your kids!

When you can, please let me know if you will be available to attend and/or willing to participate on November 14th. Additionally, if you know of any students or other professors who may be interested please do let me know. Also, feel free to pass this message along to anybody involved with GIS across all Stanford departments.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Regards,
