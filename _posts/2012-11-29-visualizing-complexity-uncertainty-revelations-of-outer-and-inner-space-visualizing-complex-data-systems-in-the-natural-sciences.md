Please join Visualizing Complexity & Uncertainty **next Wednesday, December 5, 4:15 pm**, in the Stanford Humanities Center Boardroom for the final talk/discussion of our fall series, *Revelations of Outer and Inner Space: Visualizing Complex Data Systems in the Natural Sciences.*

  At this session <strong>Erica Swesey Savig</strong> - MArch, Designer/Researcher at <a href="http://www.labstudio.org/" target="_blank">LabStudio</a>, and PhD Candidate in Cancer Biology in the Nolan Lab at the Stanford School of Medicine &#8211; will present &#8220;<strong>Customized Approaches for Visual Exploration of Complex Biological Data</strong>&#8220;.</p> <p>
    Description:

  <div>
    <span style="font-family: times new roman,new york,times,serif;">Contextual understanding of an information domain is typically acquired by a domain expert through years of experience and is the established foundation for their intuition and judgment that provide for better decision-making. Complex datasets often have the potential to contribute a wealth of knowledge to a domain, including such contextual complexities and nuances of the system under study. However, despite the continued development of analytical techniques, drawing conclusions from massive datasets remains difficult. One problem to date has been the dominance of generic data representation approaches that do not take advantage of inherent contextual visual processing systems built into the human brain, and thus make data exploration more difficult. For instance, at a high level, humans did not evolve to “see” tables of numbers or even line graphs; rather, humans evolved to “see” a 3D world. As such, considerable brain processing power is left untapped when interpreting data in a figure or linear presentation of ideas.</span>

  The goal of this work is to create natural and contextual data visualization approaches, to enhance the study of single cell biological systems for immunity and cancer research. In designing visualizations for complex, systems-level data, a customized approach unique to the context and type of data adds subjectivity that leverages scientists’ existing intuition about the system, while enhancing their memory of the data. Applying both manual and algorithmic techniques that are currently driving contemporary architectural design, data is organized, filtered, layered, styled and quantified, in a semi-automated manner. The initial use of this approach led to a series of tools and discoveries that emerged from a deep exploration into the morphological changes of motile smooth muscle cells affected by the structural nature of underlying collagen substrates. Its recent application to the design of an interactive map of ovarian cancer and immune cell behaviors facilitates the visual exploration of the more abstract, multi-dimensional single-cell data acquired using mass cytometry.</p> <p>
