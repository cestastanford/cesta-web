Our Visualizing Evidence workshop is well under way. Last week Erik Steiner was on campus to deliver his presentation in person, and we got to play with the new digital wall in the renovated Learning Theater. This workshop includes a wide range of participants and guest speakers. Each workshop presentation is followed by hands-on work in the CESTA lab upstairs. Be sure to check out the workshop <a href="https://visualizing-evidence.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">website</a> for more details and updates.
