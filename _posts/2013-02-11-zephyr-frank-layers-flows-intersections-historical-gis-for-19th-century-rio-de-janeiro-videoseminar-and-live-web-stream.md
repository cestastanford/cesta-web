Zephyr Frank: ***“Layers, Flows, Intersections: Historical GIS for 19th-century Rio de Janeiro”***

A digitized map of 1866 Rio de Janeiro, with historically accurate renderings of streets and  property parcels, provides the setting in which more than 300,000 historic records including names, addresses, and other detailed information have been organized in a database and plotted in space to reveal interconnections, networks, movement, and change over time. The digitized maps and data created by the project provide the spatially-oriented resources for dynamic visualizations. In particular, it is possible to explore movement, social networks, and the intensity of urban experience through the use of GIS-based visualization techniques.  This paper argues for the use of these techniques as an aide to understanding historical experience as “felt and lived” in a rich spatial context.
