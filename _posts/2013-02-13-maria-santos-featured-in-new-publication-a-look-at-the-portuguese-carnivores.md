CARNIVORA just edited its first book titled “Um Olhar Sobre os Carnívoros Portugueses” – “A Look at the Portuguese Carnivores” (available only in Portuguese).
Edited by Filipa Loureiro, Nuno Miguel Pedroso, Maria João Santos and Luís Miguel Rosalino, with illustrations by Carla Marques, this book aims to describe in a comprehensive but easy to read way, the terrestrial carnivorous species of the Portuguese fauna and its natural history.

The book arises from the Association’s realization of the need to have a publication bringing together scientifically solid information about this group of species, presented in a manner accessible to the general public.
