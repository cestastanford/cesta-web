This talk explores the popular phenomenon of “cabin porn” – images of beautiful cabins – as digital mediations of ideas of nature and authenticity. The rise of cabin porn as a visual genre re ects a growing international interest in cabins, shedworking, and rustic, exurban living off the grid – most of it romanticizing rural and low-tech lifestyles. On the surface, the disembodied architecture of cabin porn seems to be a form of nostalgia, where the dream of the cabin becomes an arena for resolving an ambivalent relationship to technology and all the bothersome things of modern life. Delving deeper into the cabin porn phenomenon, however, can also tell us something about the mediated experience of nature through digital media. By actively comparing the visual nostalgia of cabin porn with the historical development of cabin cultures in Scandinavia and the United States, this talk investigates how embodied and historical experiences of authenticity and the natural sublime take on new shapes in new media.
