      <strong>Premier of Three New Films to share Struggles for Environment, Justice and Community in East Palo Alto</strong><strong></strong>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      On Monday, March 18 from 6:30 to 8:30 pm East Palo Alto youth, community organizations, and Stanford University’s Program on Urban Studies will premier <em>Homegrown: Cultivating Dreams through Action – </em>three unique hip hop documentary films highlighting powerful stories from East Palo Alto. This free, community event will take place in East Palo Alto City Hall, 2145 University Ave.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The films merge hip hop music video and historical documentary approaches and are a product of a unique ten week collaboration between Stanford Urban Studies students and East Palo Alto youth lyricists. Coming together as part of a class about EPA environmental issues, the teams of Stanford students and youth lyricists partnered to edit films and create sound tracks that tell three important stories in a fresh new way:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        Youth United for Community Action’s (YUCAs) campaign to close the Romic hazardous wastes recycling in an effort lasting nearly a decade and leading to state action to close the plant forever
      </li>
      <li>
        Peoples’ irrepressible desire to farm the land in East Palo Alto, and cross race, culture and time in the effort to grow their own local food -  from a time when African American community activists farmed the “Back 40” to today&#8217;s efforts by Collective Roots.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Weeks Neighborhood Plan and East Palo Alto Historical and Agricultural Society’s vision to use the plentiful land to build self-sufficiency and community through a locally-based food system.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      Films are a product of a partnership between Stanford University&#8217;s Program on Urban Studies, Youth United for Community Action, Collective Roots, Mural Music & Arts Project, Live in Peace, and the East Palo Alto Youth Action Team.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The films are an output from Urban Studies 166, <em>East Palo Alto: Reading Urban Change, </em>which is being co-taught by Michael Levin with Rebooting History, one of the Spatial History Project&#8217;s research groups.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      In addition to the film screenings, this event will feature free food, live music, and a unique glimpse into the beauty and power of the East Palo Alto community.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Support for this project is provided by partner organizations above, as well as Stanford University affiliates including Haas Center for Public Service, Institute for Diversity in the Arts, John W. Gardner Center for Youth and Their Communities, Program on Urban Studies, School of Humanities and Sciences, Stanford Arts Institute, and the Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education.
