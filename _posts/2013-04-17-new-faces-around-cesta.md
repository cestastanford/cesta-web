In addition to our new graduate fellows in Humanities + Design, we would also like everyone to be aware of some new or new-ish folks in the CESTA lab:

**Celena Allen** &#8211; GIS Specialist and project assistant
**Gabriel Wolfenstein** &#8211; Project Manager for the Mellon crowdsourcing projects (Year of the Bay, Living with the Railroads, 500 Novels)
**Melanie Conroy** &#8211; Lab Manager for Humanities + Design (not a new face, but we want to introduce her nonetheless!)
**Jason Hepler** &#8211; Academic Technology Specialist

And we have an army of new undergraduate research assistants for the spring quarter!

**Sarah Sadlier**
**Alec Powell**
**Annalise Lockhart**
**Anne Evered**
**Diego Valiente**
**Eric Eichelberger**
**Jocelyn Hickcox**
**Laura Zehender**
**Matthew Walter**
**Raina Sun**
**Van Tran**
**Willys DeVoll**
**Varun Gupta**

We hope that you all get to meet one another at some point, and be on the look out for social mixers over the summer!
