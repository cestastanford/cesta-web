The CESTA community would like to welcome the new Humanities + Design graduate fellows! The new grad fellows are Nicole DeBenedictis, Claude Willan, Maria Teodora Comsa, Marcelo Alejandro Aranda, and Hannah Marcus.

Beyond the exciting work that the fellows will be doing within Humanities + Design, this marks a new effort by CESTA to support graduate professional development as well as our already very strong undergraduate program.
