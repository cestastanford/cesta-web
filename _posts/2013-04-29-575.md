Abstract: Brazil has experienced two booms in sugarcane ethanol production in the past 40 years,  the first taking place under an authoritarian military regime that used the power of the state to foment production and the second taking place under the tutelage of the Workers’ Party’s government in its search for a new developmental model. Inflation-plagued and debt-ridden administrations intervened between the two booms, during which time the framework of the first surge—including several state agencies—was dismantled. This talk will assess the environmental and political consequences of the first ethanol boom and place it in historical context.

Professor Rogers is the author of* The Deepest Wounds: A Labor and Environmental History of Sugar in Northeast Brazil* (The University of North Carolina Press, 2010). The book was awarded the Warren Dean Prize from the Conference on Latin American History and the Henry A. Wallace Prize from the Agricultural History Society.
