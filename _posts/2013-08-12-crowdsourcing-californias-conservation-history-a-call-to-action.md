# Crowdsourcing California&#8217;s Conservation History: A Call to Action

<div>

  </p>
  
  <p>
    The public can use Green Info Network&#8217;s <a href="http://websites.greeninfo.org/mapcollaborator/cpad_dates/" target="_blank">crowdsourcing tool</a> to contribute information on California conservation lands
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <img src="http://west.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/imagecache/persondetail/maria.jpg" alt="" />The ecologist <a href="http://west.stanford.edu/people/mariasantos">Maria J. Santos</a> is a postdoctoral fellow at the Center and the Spatial History Project at Stanford. She has been assembling a meticulous portrait of conservation lands in California: lands that – since the early 19th century – have been set aside for habitat conservation, recreation and other purposes. They range in size from sprawling county, state and national parks like Yosemite to parcels as small as city parks. In all, Santos has collected information on over 53,000 open space properties across the state.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Collecting this information is vital to understanding the effectiveness of past conservation efforts, and guiding future conservation in an era of environmental change. Among the questions that Santos is posing:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      How has land cover inside those lands changed since they were established?
    </li>
    <li>
      How successful were they in conserving the natural resources and species for which they were intended?
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    The general public can now help out in this task, thanks to an <a href="http://websites.greeninfo.org/mapcollaborator/cpad_dates/">online crowdsourcing tool</a> Santos developed in collaboration with the <a href="http://greeninfo.org">Greeninfo Network</a>. The single most important metric Santos is seeking? <strong>The establishment date of each conserved area</strong>, which users can submit using a range of precision, namely the <strong>exact year</strong>, <strong>or a range of years</strong> within which they understand it was established.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In addition, users are welcome to share notes, observations and other experiences related to these properties.
  </p>

    Further instructions on using the tool are available after the Read More link.

    Using the application should be pretty straightforward.
  </div>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      Click anywhere on the map for a popup of the current dates data we have for a unit and holding.
    </li>
    <li>
      On the right, you can change base layers, toggle overlays, and create a permalink to your current map view.
    </li>
    <li>
      Using the options on the left, you can search parks by location or agency, select units or holdings to update their establishment or acquisition dates, attach notes to the map, and upload shapefiles or KMLs.
    </li>
  </ul>
