  This interactive site presents a vision of British culture and history seen through the lens of family ties. <em>Kindred Britain </em>is built on a customized database of nearly 30,000 individuals who either are British or have a familial relationship to a British person. Records in the database span the last 15 centuries and include the noteworthy and the notorious – from prime ministers, novelists and scientists to lunatics, misfits and criminals. Kindred Britain can show a family link between any two people in the database. The site can quickly diagram how a monarch connects to a sea captain, a composer to a squire, a diarist to a doctor, a poet to a banker.

  Jenkins, Meeks and Murray will talk about the process of creating <em>Kindred Britain</em>, about the site&#8217;s technical and design architecture, about <em>Kindred Britain</em>&#8216;s place in the landscape of digital humanities projects and about the possibilities for intersections between humanities scholarship and the web.
