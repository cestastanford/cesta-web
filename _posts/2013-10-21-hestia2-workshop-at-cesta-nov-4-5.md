The Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis will host the next Hestia2 event November 4-5 in Wallenberg Hall at Stanford University. During this one and one half day seminar we will explore network analysis and uncertainty in data from a number of different perspectives. It will also be an unveiling of a number of new projects.

On the first day, beginning at noon, we will learn about data intelligence based on work done at Quid, a data analytics software company based in San Francisco. Then Walter Scheidel and Elijah Meeks will present Orbis 2.0, and Dennis Wuthrich of Farallon will share Arches, a new open-source geospatial software system for cultural heritage inventory and management.

The second full program day will include a presentation from the Stanford Literary Lab on Network Theory and Dramatic Structure, comparing dramatic networks in plays from ancient Greece and Rome, Renaissance England and France, 18th-century Germany, and 19th-century Norway. And we’ll have a lunchtime talk on the geography of digestion and a geography of medical body sensors by Nick Bauch followed by a tour of networks in digital maps by Stanford’s Digital and Rare Maps Librarian.

There will also be two workshops with an opportunity for deeper engagement with new tools: Nicole Coleman and Giorgio Caviglia (DensityDesign) will offer a workshop on Palladio, a new platform for visualization of historical data. And Karl Grossner and Elijah Meeks will offer a workshop on Topotime, a new data model and graphical layout they have been working on that is designed to handle fuzzy temporal bounds and cyclical time from.

Both days will include early evening receptions in the newly renovated CESTA workspace in Wallenberg Hall with large-screen displays of work presented during the conference as well as new digital humanities work going on at CESTA and the Stanford University Libraries.
