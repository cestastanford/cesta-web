The June 2014 issue of the *Journal of American History* includes an article
written by CESTA researcher Cameron Blevins, "[Space, Nation, and the Triumph
of Region: A View of the World from Houston](http://jah.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/jau184?%0Aijkey=unucsImiwNrelaF&keytype=ref)." In the first digital history
article published by the *Journal of American History*, Blevins shows how new
technology can add to the historian's toolkit and alter our understanding of
the historical production of space and region. He uses "distant reading" to
uncover surprising and otherwise hidden spatial patterns in how a Texas
newspaper crafted a view of the world for its readers in the late nineteenth
century. In an age of national integration the newspaper constructed an
imagined geography dominated by regional connections. Blevins conducted his
research at the Spatial History Lab, which has published [an online
component](http://spatialhistory.stanford.edu/viewoftheworld)
visualizing his findings and discussing the article's digital foundation.
