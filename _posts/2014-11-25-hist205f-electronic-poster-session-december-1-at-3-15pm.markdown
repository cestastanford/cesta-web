You are cordially invited to attend the final presentations by the [HIST205F:
Digital History](http://jasonheppler.org/teaching/hist205f.2014/) students!
The event is open to the public and I encourage you to pass this announcement
along to anyone who you feel would be interested.

The students have, over the quarter, learned about the theory and method of
digital history and are applying those skills and ideas to the history of
Silicon Valley. The students have each conducted original research into the
Valley's history or, in the case of the graduate students in the course, have
pursued their own research agendas. We are ending the class with a public
electronic poster session to allow the students to share their work and
receive feedback.

The session is informal and meant for visitors to explore the projects and
talk to the students about their work. There's no set schedule, so feel free
to come and go!

**HIST205F Electronic Poster Session
