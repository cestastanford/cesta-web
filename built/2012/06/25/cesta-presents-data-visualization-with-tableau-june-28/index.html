<p>CESTA will supplement its busy summer season with an ongoing series of talks and mini-workshops called CESTA Presents. Each week, we&#8217;ll feature presentations by members and friends of the CESTA community. These presentations will vary in content and format, and are meant mainly as a somewhat informal exchange of information, ideas, and feedback for all lab participants, regardless of individual lab or project affiliation.</p>

<p>Some of the presentations will be more technical in nature, concentrating more on particular software, methods, etc., whereas other presentations will take the form of informal discussions about someone&#8217;s research. All members of the CESTA community are encouraged to attend these valuable discussions.</p>

<p>Our first presentation takes place this Thursday!</p>
