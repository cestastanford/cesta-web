<p><strong>Storyboarding Visualizations</strong></p>

<p>Storyboarding is an exercise that helps the organization of a visual argument and the definition of the user interactions that are part of a visualization. Fred Freitas will be presenting a workshop on storyboarding as a toolÂ to think through the workflow of creating visualizations and to define the dimensions of the final design. These dimensions include: the purpose of a visualization, the desired functionality, the properties of individual elements of the display, and the composition of the elements into a usable application.</p>
