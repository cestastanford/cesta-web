    General description&lt;br /&gt; The Stanford University Libraries seek an inspirational and enthusiastic individual to serve as the Geospatial Instruction and Reference Specialist. In support of campus research and instructional needs, the Geospatial Instruction and Reference Specialist designs and delivers instruction to geospatial users, assisting with the integration of geospatial skills into the curriculum. She/he will work closely with the Geospatial Manager to run the wide-ranging geospatial workshops covering both propriety and open source software. The Specialist will also manage and coordinate the hourly staff handling the bulk of reference questions asked by the users, taking on the more challenging questions as need be.
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    The Geospatial Instruction and Reference Specialist is a member of the Science and Engineering Resource Group (SERG) of the Stanford University Libraries (SUL). Together with the Geospatial Manager, this position sustains and strengthens the GIS program as the primary provider of GIS-based services, research consultation, and user education to Stanford University (SU) students, faculty and staff from all departments across campus.
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    This position is based in the Branner Earth Sciences Library, but the Geospatial Instruction and Reference Specialist collaborates with and provides support to all users interested in geospatial education across the campus. Since s/he will provide geospatial support to users from a wide-range of academic disciplines (Earth Sciences to History to Epidemiology) the ideal candidate will have demonstrable experience in applying GIS methods to a variety of disciplines.

    Specific Duties and Responsibilities&lt;br /&gt; 1. Designs, creates and delivers geospatial training and documentation to patrons and staff across a wide range of disciplines. Content of the training varies from group to group, ranging from accessing geospatial imagery and data to teaching specific GIS software applications, both proprietary and open source. This includes giving workshops ranging in size from a few individuals to classrooms of fifty people or more.
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    2. Provides expert geospatial technology consultation services to users with varying needs and abilities ranging from basic GIS skills to research level analysis involving manipulating, customizing, querying, or modeling of data. This may at times be in greater depth for patrons needing special assistance for courses or projects heavily using GIS.
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    3. Works with the Geospatial Manager to develop relevant teaching materials and targeted workshops for specific disciplines and projects. Customizes content based upon need in order to build up a suite of training materials for specific disciplines.
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    4. Manages the nine computers in the GIS lab including handling testing, updates, troubleshooting for the machines and acts as the Expert Partner for the lab.
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    5. Helps to maintain the Branner library GIS web site, creating instructional materials delivered in person and over the Web.
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    6. Supervises student or hourly workers who assists with geospatial reference, Website editing and various tasks in support of geospatial services.
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    7. Works in conjunction with the Geoportal team to identify and add relevant datasets to Stanford’s Geoportal instance.
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    8. Maintains awareness of current trends in GIS &amp; related technologies by attending user conferences and regional meetings, communicating with staff and faculty from geospatial labs at other universities, and through communication with the Stanford campus administrative units using GIS, such as the Planning and Facilities Offices.
  &lt;/p&gt;

    Qualifications
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    1. Required technical qualifications:&lt;br /&gt; • Minimum two years’ work experience or academic background with ESRI and Google geospatial products.
