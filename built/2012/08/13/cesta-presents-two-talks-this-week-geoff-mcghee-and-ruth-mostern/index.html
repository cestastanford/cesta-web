<p>Greetings,</p>

<p>CORRECTION: Please note that we actually have THREE talks this week, including <strong><em>Introduction to Data Visualization with R</em> **by Claudia Engel on</strong> Wednesday, August 15th. See details below.**</p>

<p><strong>&#8220;Envisioning California&#8217;s Delta As it Was&#8221; &#8211; A Science and Media Collaboration</strong><br>
<strong>Geoff McGhee, Creative Director, Bill Lane Center for the American West</strong><br>
<strong>Lauren Sommer, Reporter, KQED QUEST</strong><br>
<strong>Tuesday, August 14th @ Noon</strong><br>
<strong>Grand Central Room, 4th Floor Wallenberg Hall</strong></p>

<p>Geoff McGhee and Lauren Sommer will talk about their interactive map and data visualization on the historical Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. The project brought together KQED Public Media, the Bill Lane Center for the American West at Stanford, and the San Francisco Estuary Institute, in an innovative three-way collaboration among scientists, journalists and interactive media specialists. McGhee and Sommer will talk about the challenges of web-based interactive visualization, storytelling with data, and the challenge of reaching a broad audience while preserving scientific precision.</p>

<p><strong>Introduction to Data Visualization with R</strong><br>
<strong>Claudia Engel, Academic Technology Specialist and Lecturer, Department of Anthropology, Stanford</strong><br>
<strong>Wednesday, August 15th @ Noon</strong><br>
<strong>Grand Central Room, 4th Floor Wallenberg Hall</strong></p>

<p>R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics, which runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms, Windows and MacOS. ggplot2 is a plotting system for R, based on the grammar of graphics [1]. This presentation will be a gentle introduction to using ggplot2 and R to visualize data. It will also demonstrate how to map spatial data on top of popular basemaps from Google, OpenStreet, or CloudMade.</p>

<p><strong>An Information System for Large Scale Spatial History:  The Three Thousand Year Story of Sediment, Settlement and State on China&#8217;s Yellow River</strong><br>
<strong>Ruth Mostern, Associate Professor of History and Co-Director of the Spatial Analysis and Research Center (SpARC), UC Merced.</strong><br>
<strong>Thursday, August 16th @ Noon</strong><br>
<strong>Grand Central Room, 4th Floor Wallenberg Hall</strong></p>

<p>This informal talk discusses my ongoing work to identify, digitize and assemble information concerning the &#8220;big history&#8221; of China&#8217;s Yellow River.  The Yellow River is the most sediment laden river in the world, and over ninety percent of the silt comes from regions that traverse the friable and erosion-prone loess plateau, the grasslands and fragile soils  that constituted imperial China’s sedentary-pastoralist frontier.  Both Chinese and steppe regimes fortified the frontier, supported settlers, and mounted battles there.  When tensions were high and farms and garrisons proliferated, the quantity of silt entering the river increased, with disastrous consequences in the core imperial heartland of the lower river floodplain.  An abrupt increase in sediment load –a full order of magnitude of increase – occurred about one thousand years ago:  just at a moment of rising conflict between the Chinese and their steppe neighbors.  For the past year, I have been gathering spatial, temporal and ecological data concerning the entire course of the river and the correlation between the intensification of settlement on the loess plateau and the environmental degradation of the north China plain.  This talk introduces that data and outlines future steps for the development of a digital atlas and a spatial environmental history research agenda.</p>
