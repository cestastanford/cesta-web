<p>Please join us this week for a CESTA Presents event:</p>

<p><strong>Thomas Nygren, Dr of History and Education, HUMlab, Ume√• University Sweden</strong><br>
** &#8220;Digital History and the Construction of Knowledge&#8221;**<br>
** Wednesday, August 29th, 3-4pm**<br>
** Gold &amp; Honey, Wallenberg Hall (Building 160), Fourth Floor**</p>

<p>In the presentation I will present results from a finished study on incorporating digitized sources in history teaching, &#8220;Students Using the Tool of the Professional Digital Historian: Problems and Possibilities in History Teaching.&#8221; This study highlights problems and possibilities in attitudes of upper secondary-school students and their historical thinking when they are assigned the use of a historical demographic database.</p>

<p>I will also present some preliminary findings from a second study, &#8220;Students Choosing and Using Analogue and Digital Databases: Knowledge Construction with Primary Sources.&#8221; This study highlights how the same students write history when assigned work with traditional archives in comparison to digital archives.</p>

<p>Thirdly, and most importantly, I would like to listen to the audience feedback and test some ideas on how the spatial turn in history might affect knowledge construction &#8211; and how this could (and should) be studied.</p>
