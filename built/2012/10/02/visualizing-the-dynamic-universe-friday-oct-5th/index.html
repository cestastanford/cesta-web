<p><strong>&#8220;Visualizing the Dynamic Universe&#8221;</strong> presented by Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz and Morgan MacLeod of the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics at the University of California Santa Cruz.</p>

<p>Description: Empirically, astrophysical objects are not amenable to experimental studies; we rely on careful observations rather than laboratory experimentation to obtain data. Theoretically, astrophysical objects are rarely amenable to simple physical models; we rely increasingly on computational methods to understand the complicated physics that governs the phenomena we observe. With the advancement of computer technology and numerical algorithms, complex astrophysical phenomena are now accessible via simulation almost as if they were accessible via experiments in the laboratory. But humans are visual creatures. Numbers alone do little to feed our understanding and intuition. In our talk we will share our approach to visualization and the discuss the ways it informs our research in theoretical astrophysics. Through an iterative process of simulation and comparison to observational data, we work toward an understanding of astrophysical phenomena that is both qualitative and quantitative. Visual representations of our data form the essential link in this iterative process; they are much more than a final product. In our projects with OpenLab &#8212; a collaboration between UCSC artists and astronomers – we have been working to fully realize the scientific and aesthetic potential of these simulations.</p>
