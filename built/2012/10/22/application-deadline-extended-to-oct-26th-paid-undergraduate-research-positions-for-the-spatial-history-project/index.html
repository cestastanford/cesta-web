<p><strong>Application deadline has been extended to 5pm, Friday Oct. 26th!</strong></p>

<p>The Spatial History Project is now accepting applications for paid undergraduate Research Assistants. We are currently hiring independent and motivated students to engage in original research and can positively impact the following research projects (please note that some positions will begin immediately this Autumn while others will begin in Winter 2013). Instructions for applying follow the project descriptions. Pay rate is $15 per hour.</p>

<p><strong>Enchanting the Desert</strong></p>

<p>Enchanting the Desert uses the 1930s narrated photographic slideshows of Zion and Grand Canyon National Parks made by Henry Peabody as its launching point.  While the immediate goal of the project is to make these slideshows accessible in a multi-media, online format, one of its deeper goals is to interpret Peabody’s landscape images from the perspective of contemporary 1930s geographical theorist Richard Hartshorne.  To do this, a series of viewing options, or modes, will be constructed, each augmenting the original slideshows in ways that meaning – both from human stories and fauna population data – changes the experience of viewing the slideshows.</p>

<p>The project seeks one undergraduate Research Assistant, whose skillsets and interests should include some or most of the following:<br>
- History of photography<br>
- Historical geography of U.S. National Parks<br>
- Excellent library/archive research skills<br>
- Desire to think creatively about how to wed geographical information with photographs<br>
- Software: web design, GIS, Photoshop, Illustrator<br>
- Desire to create new online environments<br>
- Excitement for careful, close reading of slideshow narratives<br>
- Field biology (especially historical fauna survey data)<br>
- Folklore</p>

<p>Work on this project will begin at the onset of Winter Quarter 2013.</p>

<p><strong>Forming Selves</strong></p>

<p>Forming Selves: The Creation of Child Psychiatry from Red Vienna to the Third Reich and Abroad is a new project led by Prof. Edith Sheffer that traces linkages among the forerunners of child psychiatry from Vienna in the 1930s through the 1940s, outlining connections among the diaspora and those who stayed during the rise of Nazi Germany. With the advent of the Third Reich, many who were Jewish and politically opposed to the regime fled Vienna and established their own practices in England, the United States, and beyond, leading the field of child development. Meanwhile, a cohort of psychologists and psychiatrists remained in Vienna, a number of whom took leading roles in the Nazi euthanasia program, overseeing the murders of hundreds of disabled children. This research will offer an international history of a discipline that is usually examined within national networks or within discrete schools of thought, following social as well as intellectual ties in the field. It will also consider how experiences under Nazism and the Second World War may have shaped the trajectory of child psychiatry in different places, with alternate priorities such as war orphans, clinical research, and Nazi eugenics resulting in divergent approaches.</p>

<p>Forming Selves seeks one undergraduate Research Assistant to build a database of these practitioners and their professional and personal connections to one another, and subsequently create network visualizations to explore interesting and surprising connections within this community. Preferred candidates will adeptly investigate and interpret primary source documents. A strong reading knowledge of German is preferred. Experience with network graphing software like Gephi and Pajek is a plus. Candidate should list any technical skills in their application and demonstrate a strong interest in learning new tools and advancing work in the digital humanities. Work on this project will begin at the onset of Winter Quarter 2013.</p>

<p><strong>Geography of the Post</strong></p>

<p>Geography of the Post maps the growth of the United States Postal System in the late nineteenth century into a vast, continent-spanning communications network. The project explores the network on its western periphery: where it spread, how it operated, and its role in shaping the space and place of the region. Geography of the Post uses the postal system as a way to explore larger topics in American history, including community development, the character and reach of the federal government in the nineteenth century, and how flows of information tied together the social, political, and economic fabric of the West.</p>

<p>Geography of the Post seeks one undergraduate Research Assistant for the Autumn and Winter Quarters (with possible extension into the spring and summer) to help map the U.S. Post. The RA will first use historical documents to compile a database of offices, postmasters, and carrier routes. They will then analyze locations, people, and connections in order to map the contours of the system. The RA will use a wide variety of technical tools: database creation and management, geospatial analysis using ArcGIS, network applications such as Gephi, and data visualization through Processing and Adobe Creative Suite. Prior training is not required, but candidates should include any technical expertise in their application and must demonstrate interest in history or other relevant fields such as geography, political science, economics, sociology, or communications. Work on this project will begin immediately.</p>

<p><strong>The Forma Urbis Romae Project</strong></p>

<p>In 1901, Rodolfo Lanciani produced a cartographic masterpiece that still remains the most comprehensive map of the archeological history of any city in the world. The Forma Urbis Romae is an extremely accurate map, produced on 46 plates and measuring a massive 25 ft across when fully assembled. Using an innovative graphical system of layers and linked data (much like a modern GIS), the map simultaneously captures several epoch’s of Rome’s urban fabric over a 2,000 year period. The Lanciani map is the definitive archeological reference for Rome even though it is some 110 years out of date.</p>

<p>Our research intends to critically examine, update and republish the map as an interactive website and mobile app that will also serve as a way to experience and understand Rome’s 2,000 year spatial history. The result will reveal an image of the city in a way that has never been seen in its entirety. Potential RA responsibilities are to remaster and republish the Lanciani map in digital form, to document and analyze historic maps and texts to examine how Rome has evolved from antiquity to today, and to identify errors, omissions, and gaps in the 1901 map. The research offers potential inquiry into architectural history, archeological discovery, and urban morphology, among other fields. RAs may gain experience in GIS, cartographic design, Adobe Illustrator, textual analysis, Italian language, and web/mobile development and will have the freedom to explore independent research questions within the project framework.</p>

<p>Project collaborators will be located off-campus, and candidates must be able to take initiative and have strong organizational and communication skills. Work on this project will begin Winter Quarter 2013.</p>

<p><strong>The Law of the Antebellum Frontier</strong></p>

<p>Using a massive amount of U.S. Census and city atlas data, The Law of the Antebellum Frontier project is working to demonstrate the patterns of migration on the frontier, both into and out of St. Louis, of numerous sub-populations of interest, including both the free black and slave populations present during this era. As St. Louis was considered a &#8220;staging area&#8221; for those who were travelling further west, it is essential that this critical city of the frontier is mapped with greater detail than ever before.</p>

<p>The Law of the Antebellum Frontier seeks one undergraduate Research Assistant, to start Winter Quarter 2013 and continue through Spring Quarter (with a possible extension into summer). The Research Assistant will be responsible for building historical GIS data layers to represent St. Louis in the mid-nineteenth century, using historic map sources and census records. Tasks will include georeferencing historic maps, digitizing features in ArcGIS, and building databases. Data visualizations produced by the Research Assistant in ArcGIS, Tableau, and other software will provide new avenues for historical inquiry.</p>

<p>Experience working with GIS is not required, but a strong interest in developing new technical skills is a must. Candidates should have a demonstrated interest in history or allied fields in the social sciences. Project collaborators will be located off-campus, and candidates must be able to take initiative and have strong organizational and communication skills. Work on this project will begin Winter Quarter 2013.</p>

<p><strong>Reconstructing California Conservation History</strong></p>

<p>In an era of environmental change, it is important to assess our legacy on the landscape and to understand the efficacy of our efforts to conserve natural resources. This is a challenging task, as the information on conservation history is scattered through multiple sources, organizations, and governance levels. It is also an exciting task, as the data assembled through this project will provide us with the means to assess the relative success of our conservation actions. We have been working on this project for a almost a year now, and several directions have been taken that include: changes in land cover and climate and how they relate to land acquisition; analysis of biodiversity and open space acquisition; analysis of transportation and urban development and its relation with open space acquisition; and analysis of redwood logging and its relationship with park establishment and carbon stocks.</p>

<p>Moving forward, the project seeks a motivated and independent Research Assistant to: (1) aid in the larger project and investigate the acquisition and establishment dates of open space properties throughout California; and (2) develop an independent project that looks into the economics of conservation land acquisition. This entails (1) researching open space properties acquisition (typically online), (2) contacting managing agencies to request information via email and phone, (3) learning GIS, and (4) data entry and analysis within a GIS framework. The Research Assistant will see their work integrated into a larger state-wide effort to answer important questions on the effectiveness of protected areas to preserve natural resources in California. Work will begin immediately.</p>

<p><strong>Western Railroads</strong></p>

<p>Western Railroads is a new project that augments and builds on the ongoing research of Richard White by tapping into the collective knowledge of railroad enthusiasts and local historians. An interactive website developed in partnership with an established web development firm will make a large collection of historic photographs depicting railroads available to the railroad enthusiast community for keyword tagging/textual description and placement on a webmap. Additionally, the website will feature historic maps from the David Rumsey collection, and ask participants to mark key map features&#8211;digitizing those features in a way that makes them usable for both the enthusiast and scholarly communities.</p>

<p>The undergraduate Research Assistant will help get this effort off the ground by spearheading an outreach effort with railroad enthusiast communities and local historical societies; organize content for the site as necessary, including using GIS to place (geo-rectify) historic maps in digital coordinate space; and develop concepts and mock-ups for the web interface. Preliminary site designs developed by the Research Assistant will help answer such questions as: what sorts of features will users be asked to identify, and how will this data be recorded; what features should be included in the interface; and how can the site award helpful contributors and build community amongst rail enthusiasts and scholars?</p>

<p>Preferred candidates will have a a theoretical/conceptual interest and some background in social media, website development, and game design. Candidates with an interest in environmental history, U.S. history, human-environment relations, and related social science disciplines are encouraged to apply. Experience with web technologies (HTML 5, CSS, JavaScript) is a definite plus, but not required, as is an interest in learning geographic information systems (GIS) and information visualization software like Tableau. We seek organized self-starters who can make a commitment to work through the academic year. The position is only open to current Stanford undergraduate students and will begin immediately.</p>

<p><strong>Year of the Bay</strong></p>

<p>Year of the Bay is a new project that seeks to enrich environmental history research on the San Francisco Bay Area, deriving information contained in photographs, art, maps and other sources, by directly engaging the public — or crowdsourcing local knowledge. The project will work with an established web development firm to make a formidable digital collection of photographs, art, maps and other materials available to the public in the form of an interactive interface that allows users to geo-tag and contextualize primary source materials and add their own historical materials to an online archive.</p>

<p>The undergraduate Research Assistant will help develop materials and concepts in this project&#8217;s early stages; reach out to local historical societies, museums, libraries, and community organizations; help organize and participate in events online and in real life to encourage community engagement in the project; help organize historical materials to be placed on the site; and analyze the results of the crowdsourcing, developing and testing hypotheses regarding different crowdsourcing outcomes achieved through a variety of user interfaces, including game-like structures for public participation.</p>

<p>Preferred candidates will have a theoretical/conceptual interest and some background in social media, website development, and game design. Also important is an interest in environmental history and the use of maps, photographs, and other primary source documents. Technical proficiency in website design (HTML 5, CSS, JavaScript) and web mapping (OpenLayers, Google Maps API) is a plus, but not required. The Research Assistant will collaborate with researchers located off campus, and will be independently motivated and well organized, with excellent communication skills. The position is only open to current Stanford undergraduate students and will begin immediately.</p>
