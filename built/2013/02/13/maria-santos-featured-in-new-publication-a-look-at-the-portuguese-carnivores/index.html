<p>CARNIVORA just edited its first book titled “Um Olhar Sobre os Carnívoros Portugueses” – “A Look at the Portuguese Carnivores” (available only in Portuguese).<br>
Edited by Filipa Loureiro, Nuno Miguel Pedroso, Maria João Santos and Luís Miguel Rosalino, with illustrations by Carla Marques, this book aims to describe in a comprehensive but easy to read way, the terrestrial carnivorous species of the Portuguese fauna and its natural history.</p>

<p>The book arises from the Association’s realization of the need to have a publication bringing together scientifically solid information about this group of species, presented in a manner accessible to the general public.</p>
