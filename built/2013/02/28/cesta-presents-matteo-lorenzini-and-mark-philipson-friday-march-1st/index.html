<p>Greetings,</p>

<p>You are invited to the following back-to-back presentations this <strong>Friday, March 1st, in CESTA:</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Predictive Models and Semantic Representation of Archaeological Datasets: The Case of the Alghero district, Sardinia (Italy).<br /> Matteo Lorenzini<br /> 11:30am-12:15pm</strong></span></p>

<p>One of the most important characteristics of research about the archaeological landscape is the definition of a global approach to the analysis of formative processes, i.e. the different anthropic and natural traces that have contributed to the making of a particular landscape context. The refinement of the methodology applied to landscape analysis has brought to a rapid increase in the predictive analysis of both the archaeological landscape and the geographic distributions of archaeological evidences, through the use of a variety of standard statistical techniques. My talk will introduce a case study in the landscape analysis of the Alghero district in Sardinia (Italy).</p>

<p>This district is being studied since the 19th century and, currently, is the object of research of the University of Sassari and the Archaeological Superintendence of Sassari. The analysis takes into consideration different settlement dynamics and environmental markers that characterized human settlements from the prehistorical age to late medieval period.</p>

<p>My approach integrates geo-statistical analysis with the semantic representation of archaeological evidences. Distributive and predictive models are being created in a GIS open source platform that integrates the Maximum Entropy algorithm (MAXENT) and the R statistical package with GRASS GIS. In addition, my work researches on the semantic representation of archaeological features as a crucial component in landscape analysis. This kind of representation will be modeled in the Geographical Information System together with the spatial component in order to connect the local database with external sources, offering additional data for landscape analysis.</p>

<span style="font-size: large;">Mediathread<br /> Mark Philipson<br /> 12:30 &#8211; 1:15pm</span>**</p>

<p>Mediathread is an open-source platform for exploration, analysis, and organization of web-based multimedia content.</p>

<p>Mediathread connects to a variety of image and video collections (such as YouTube, Flickr, library databases, and course libraries), enabling users to lift items out of these collections and into an analysis environment. In Mediathread, items can then be clipped, annotated, organized, and embedded into essays and other written analysis.</p>

Presentations will take place in CESTA on the fourth floor of Wallenberg Hall (Building 160). Lunch will be provided.</p>
