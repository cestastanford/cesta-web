<p>Please join Visualizing Complexity &amp; Uncertainty <strong>next Thursday, March 7 at Noon</strong>, in Wallenberg Hall for the third talk of our winter series.</p>

<p><strong>Reviel Netz </strong>&#8211; Professor of Classics and, by courtesy, Philosophy (Stanford) &#8212; will present <strong>&#8220;</strong><strong>Making Sense of Greek Culture: Maps, Numbers, Thoughts&#8221;</strong></p>

<p>*<em>Description:<br>
*</em>In my presentation I try to do two things: share my recent research into the geographical patterns of Greek cultural life, and reflect on the quasi-statistical, vaguely quantitative, &#8220;methodology&#8221; typical to much of my work. In between the Digital Humanities, on the one hand, and the traditional philologist&#8217;s close reading, on the other hand, there lies a region of small samples, studied by hand &#8211; where the sensibility of the scholar can dwell on the detail of data.</p>

<p>*<em>Thursday, March 7, 12:00 pm<br>
*</em>&#8220;Gold n Honey&#8221; meeting space, 4th floor of Wallenberg Hall (bldg. 160) &#8212; (Please note the change from our regular venue; the elevator will be open.)<br>
Lunch will be served.</p>

<p>We hope to see you there!</p>
