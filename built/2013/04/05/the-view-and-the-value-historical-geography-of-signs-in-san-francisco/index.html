  My research examines signs in the public view of San Francisco, from the 1890s to the present. This curious and surprising line of local history indicates how cultural values influence the organization of space, relying upon maps identifying <em>where </em>and <em>when </em>signs have existed and textual sources that compare the laws of public versus private signage. With this case study, I hope to demonstrate the points at which property rights intersect and conflict with the freedom of speech.

  During the past decade, corporate expenditures for advertising completed the shift away from print media and toward digital formats. Outdoor advertising experienced no such decline. I argue that the outdoor medium will become increasingly relevant, but the industry will become unrecognizable in the digital age. Soon, the development of virtual spaces for public and private speech will raise new questions about the management of real space. Can the ongoing controversy over online privacy inform the future of public control over open spaces? The answer requires proof that billboards create value for cities&#8211;or proof of the opposite.
