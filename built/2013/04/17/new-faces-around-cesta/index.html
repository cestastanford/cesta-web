<p>In addition to our new graduate fellows in Humanities + Design, we would also like everyone to be aware of some new or new-ish folks in the CESTA lab:</p>

<p><strong>Celena Allen</strong> &#8211; GIS Specialist and project assistant<br>
<strong>Gabriel Wolfenstein</strong> &#8211; Project Manager for the Mellon crowdsourcing projects (Year of the Bay, Living with the Railroads, 500 Novels)<br>
<strong>Melanie Conroy</strong> &#8211; Lab Manager for Humanities + Design (not a new face, but we want to introduce her nonetheless!)<br>
<strong>Jason Hepler</strong> &#8211; Academic Technology Specialist</p>

<p>And we have an army of new undergraduate research assistants for the spring quarter!</p>

<p><strong>Sarah Sadlier</strong><br>
<strong>Alec Powell</strong><br>
<strong>Annalise Lockhart</strong><br>
<strong>Anne Evered</strong><br>
<strong>Diego Valiente</strong><br>
<strong>Eric Eichelberger</strong><br>

<strong>Laura Zehender</strong><br>
<strong>Matthew Walter</strong><br>
<strong>Raina Sun</strong><br>
<strong>Van Tran</strong><br>
<strong>Willys DeVoll</strong><br>

<p>We hope that you all get to meet one another at some point, and be on the look out for social mixers over the summer!</p>
