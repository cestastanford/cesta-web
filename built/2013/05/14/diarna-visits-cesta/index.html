<p>Aron Rodrigue brought guests from the Diarna project to CESTA to share ideas about how to gather and share historical spatial data. <a href="http://diarna.org">Diarna</a> (&#8220;our homes&#8221; in judeo-arabic) is a Digital Heritage Mapping project and geo-museum dedicated to documenting important sites in Jewish life in the Middle East and North Africa.</p>

<p>Jason Guberman and Frances Malino showed us how they collect references to sites and images of sites from Google Books, Hathi Trust and other cultural heritage archives. They combine these resources with site visits to gather any remaining evidence of sites that either have been destroyed or are in danger of being destroyed. They collect personal accounts and photographs on site, then rapidly build 3D models based on surviving evidence to produce rich online exhibits that include Google Earth fly throughs, 360 degree views, photographs, video and audio and text.</p>

<p>Not only are they constructing an extraordinarily rich archive, they are doing it with widely available tools: Trimble 3D warehouse, Sketchup, Picasa, YouTube, and 360 Cities.</p>
