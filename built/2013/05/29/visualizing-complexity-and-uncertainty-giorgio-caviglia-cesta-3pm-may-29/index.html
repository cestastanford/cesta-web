  <strong>Dealing with uncertainty, instability and uniqueness: designers as (digital) reflective practitioners</strong></p> <div>
  </div>

    <strong>Description</strong>

  <div>
    The<strong> </strong>notion of designers as ‘reflective practitioners’ has been proposed by Donald Schön more than thirty years ago, to describe a specific way of knowing that is grounded in making and in a continuos conversation with the material of a design situation. More than starting from abstract planning, designers move through improvised actions and moment-by-moment responses to immediate needs and contexts. This idea of reflection-in-action represents a powerful tool for understanding, criticizing restructuring and acting within situations of<strong> </strong>uncertainty, complexity and value conflicts. Is it possible (and useful) to bring this notion of design-reasoning<strong> </strong>within humanities contexts? And in such a perspective, which can be the<strong> </strong>role of designers, visualizations and interfaces?

<div>
  After receiving his PhD in Design at the Politecnico di Milano in 2013, Giorgio Caviglia is currently a postdoc at the DensityDesign Lab (Politecnico di Milano). His research stems from the intersection of Design and Digital Humanities: in particular, he is interested in deepening the relationships between designers, scholars and computer scientists in the definition of new humanities research methods and tools based on digital environments and data. Working on the design and the development of visualizations and interfaces for years, his work has been presented in numerous exhibitions and publications, including MediaLAB Prado, SIGGRAPH, MIT HyperStudio, Data Flow, Malofiej, Visual Complexity.
