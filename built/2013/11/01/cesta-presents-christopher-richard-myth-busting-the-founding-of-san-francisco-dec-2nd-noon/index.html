<p><span style="font-size: small;">Juan Bautista de Anza chose the locations for the mission and presidio in San Francisco in March 1776. Anza and his chaplain, Fr. Font, spent three days analyzing the agricultural and strategic potential of the various neighborhoods of San Francisco before siteing the mission and presidio. They gave the name <em>Dolors </em>to the water supply that they expected to provide for agriculture at the mission. Three months later when the settlers arrived, the writings of the pastor, Fr. Palou, reinterpreted the water feature named Dolores.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: small;">This engendered a long-standing controversy about the pre-European terrain of San Francisco, the analysis of which touches upon tales which, while incorrect, are held as legend. This adds an epistemological challenge to righting the record, not present in most presentations of research. In this case, the first-person journals were detailed, sophisticated, and in agreement, however challenged in narrative structure. The controversy is largely traceable to a mis-translation/interpretation in the 1860s, which blossomed into controversy at the centennial in 1876, and which is hotly contested to this day. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: small;">A succession of maps from the Land-Case collection at the Bancroft Library, newly brought into the discussion, along with the extreme geomorphic unlikelihood of the legendary version, make a clear case for a revised history of the event and terrain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: small;">Christopher Richard is a recently retired curator of aquatic biology at Oakland Museum of California. During 30 years at the museum he curated two major permanent gallery expansions and a dozen temporary exhibitions. The majority of his research was heading a team mapping the modern and historic hydrology of urbanized portions of the S.F. Bay Area, resulting in 15 published maps. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: small;"> Since 2006, he has been studying the records of the Anza expeditions to California in the 1770s. These provide valuable baseline descriptions of aquatic habitats prior to significant modification by European influence. He is in the process of revisiting all the sites described by Anza to determine the relative health of the remaining aquatic habitats.<span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><br /> </span></span></p>
