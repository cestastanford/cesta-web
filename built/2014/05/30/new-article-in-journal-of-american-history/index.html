<p>The June 2014 issue of the <em>Journal of American History</em> includes an article 
written by CESTA researcher Cameron Blevins, &quot;<a href="http://jah.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/jau184?%0Aijkey=unucsImiwNrelaF&amp;keytype=ref">Space, Nation, and the Triumph 
of Region: A View of the World from Houston</a>.&quot; In the first digital history 
article published by the <em>Journal of American History</em>, Blevins shows how new 
technology can add to the historian&#39;s toolkit and alter our understanding of 
the historical production of space and region. He uses &quot;distant reading&quot; to 
uncover surprising and otherwise hidden spatial patterns in how a Texas 
newspaper crafted a view of the world for its readers in the late nineteenth 
century. In an age of national integration the newspaper constructed an 
imagined geography dominated by regional connections. Blevins conducted his 
research at the Spatial History Lab, which has published <a href="http://spatialhistory.stanford.edu/viewoftheworld">an online 
component</a> 
visualizing his findings and discussing the article&#39;s digital foundation.</p>
