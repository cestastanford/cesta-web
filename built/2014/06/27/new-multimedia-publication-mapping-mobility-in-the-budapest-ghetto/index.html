<p>In collaboration with the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM.org), the Spatial History Project is pleased to announce the release of an interactive multimedia publication entitled &quot;<a href="http://web.stanford.edu/group/spatialhistory/cgi-bin/site/viz.php?id=411&amp;project_id=">Mapping Mobility in the Budapest Ghetto</a>.&quot;</p>

<p>The project features research by historian <strong>Tim Cole</strong> and geographer <strong>Alberto Giordano</strong> of the Holocaust Geographies Collaborative, an international research group affiliated with the Spatial History Project.  The multimedia publication investigates news ways of understanding the experience and definition of the ghetto in 1944 Budapest. Combining traditional historical research methods with network analysis and computer simulation, we modeled how the Jewish population may have been distributed in the city. The resulting animation shows, moment by moment, how restrictions in space (where Jews could and could not live) and time (when Jews could leave their homes) created a distorted geography that led to different levels of mobility, access, and vulnerability.</p>
