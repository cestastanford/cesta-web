<p>You are cordially invited to attend the final presentations by the <a href="http://jasonheppler.org/teaching/hist205f.2014/">HIST205F: 
Digital History</a> students! 
The event is open to the public and I encourage you to pass this announcement 
along to anyone who you feel would be interested.</p>

<p>The students have, over the quarter, learned about the theory and method of 
digital history and are applying those skills and ideas to the history of 
Silicon Valley. The students have each conducted original research into the 
Valley&#39;s history or, in the case of the graduate students in the course, have 
pursued their own research agendas. We are ending the class with a public 
electronic poster session to allow the students to share their work and 
receive feedback.</p>

<p>The session is informal and meant for visitors to explore the projects and 
talk to the students about their work. There&#39;s no set schedule, so feel free 
to come and go!</p>
