    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Spatial History Project within the Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis (CESTA) at Stanford seeks to hire undergraduate Research Assistants to work on a variety of digital projects based in humanities scholarship at the nexus of history, English, art, and geography. We seek students who bring practical knowledge or interest in information design and the development of interactive visualization tools for humanities research.</p>

<ul>
<li>  Successful candidates will have a strong background or interest in learning in any of the following areas:</li>
<li>  Information visualization and design (e.g. graphic design, cartography, programming, interaction design</li>
<li>  Adobe CS, JavaScript, ActionScript d3, etc)</li>
<li>  Spatial and network analysis (GIS, Tableau, Gephi, etc)</li>
<li>  Archival research, data analysis, database creation and management</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples of possible projects that new research assistants could be involved are:</p>

<p><strong>Living with the Railroads</strong><br>
Following the work of Richard White, Living with the Railroads seeks to use crowdsourcing to learn more about the social, cultural, and environmental impact of the development and expansion of the railroads in the American West, and hopefully eventually across the United States. The goal, in conjunction with Historypin, is to get railroad enthusiasts to upload their data, identify images and documents whose provenance is unknown, and help facilitate the growth of connections between enthusiast and enthusiast communities, while at the same time collecting metadata on these images.</p>

<p><strong>Chinese Railroad Workers</strong><br>
Faculty Gordon Chang (History) and Shelley Fisher Fishkin (English) are leading this project to unearth the undocumented history of the Chinese workers who constructed the U.S. transcontinental railroad in the late 1860s. This project seeks to discover and present this missing history from many different sources. Participants from a wide range of backgrounds, disciplines, and locations are working together to piece this history together.</p>

<p><strong>Geography of the Post</strong><br>
From the end of the Civil War until the close of the nineteenth century, the United States Postal System grew into a vast communications network. The Post was one of the century&#8217;s largest spatial systems, with more than 75,000 offices connecting communities scattered across the continent. Geography of the Post maps this behemoth network on its western periphery: where it spread, how it operated, and its role in shaping the space and place of the region.</p>

<p><strong>The Law of the Antebellum Frontier</strong><br>
Innovative digital research technologies allow us to look at the expansion of the American nation during the critical years before the Civil War in new ways.</p>

<p><strong>A Microhistory of the Great Migration The Great Migration</strong> was a watershed in African American life: over the course of six decades (1910-1970), six million black southerners left the South in search of more meaningful experiences of freedom. This project hopes to offer a different angle of vision on the migration by bringing to light the places where migrants slept, ate, got haircuts, and danced along the way.</p>

<p><strong>Rebooting History</strong><br>
This project is an exploration with a point of origin in how regional utilization of East Palo Alto&#8217;s space helped set the stage for a dynamic of inequality between the community and what would become Silicon Valley.</p>

<p><strong>Genealogy of Desert Ant Colonies</strong> Over the past 3 decades, Gordon has studied the behavior, demography and ecology of a population of about 300 harvester ant colonies in Arizona, using both field and laboratory experiments.</p>

<p>Working hours are flexible, with a target of 8-10 hours per week. RAs will join an exciting community of scholars including undergraduates, graduate students, post-docs, and faculty. RAs will have the opportunity to co-author projects and potentially include their own work in their portfolio. In addition to technical skills, RAs must demonstrate past success in creative problem solving, and a devotion to teamwork.</p>

<p>Please send your resume and a cover letter explaining your qualifications to Matt Bryant (mattbryant.stanford@gmail.com) no later than <strong>noon on Monday, December 2nd.</strong></p>

<p>Please share this announcement with anyone who you feel might be interested.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>Crowdsourcing California&#8217;s Conservation History: A Call to Action</h1>

<div>
  <p>
    <a href="http://websites.greeninfo.org/mapcollaborator/cpad_dates/" target="_blank"><img src="http://west.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/crowdsourcing-screenshot-01-1080px.jpg" alt="" /></a>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The public can use Green Info Network&#8217;s <a href="http://websites.greeninfo.org/mapcollaborator/cpad_dates/" target="_blank">crowdsourcing tool</a> to contribute information on California conservation lands
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <img src="http://west.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/imagecache/persondetail/maria.jpg" alt="" />The ecologist <a href="http://west.stanford.edu/people/mariasantos">Maria J. Santos</a> is a postdoctoral fellow at the Center and the Spatial History Project at Stanford. She has been assembling a meticulous portrait of conservation lands in California: lands that – since the early 19th century – have been set aside for habitat conservation, recreation and other purposes. They range in size from sprawling county, state and national parks like Yosemite to parcels as small as city parks. In all, Santos has collected information on over 53,000 open space properties across the state.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Collecting this information is vital to understanding the effectiveness of past conservation efforts, and guiding future conservation in an era of environmental change. Among the questions that Santos is posing:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      How has land cover inside those lands changed since they were established?
    </li>
    <li>
      How successful were they in conserving the natural resources and species for which they were intended?
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    The general public can now help out in this task, thanks to an <a href="http://websites.greeninfo.org/mapcollaborator/cpad_dates/">online crowdsourcing tool</a> Santos developed in collaboration with the <a href="http://greeninfo.org">Greeninfo Network</a>. The single most important metric Santos is seeking? <strong>The establishment date of each conserved area</strong>, which users can submit using a range of precision, namely the <strong>exact year</strong>, <strong>or a range of years</strong> within which they understand it was established.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In addition, users are welcome to share notes, observations and other experiences related to these properties.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Further instructions on using the tool are available after the Read More link.

  <div>
    <strong>Instructions on using the tool:</strong>
  </div>
  
  <div>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    Using the application should be pretty straightforward.
  </div>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      Click anywhere on the map for a popup of the current dates data we have for a unit and holding.
    </li>
    <li>
      On the right, you can change base layers, toggle overlays, and create a permalink to your current map view.
    </li>
    <li>
      Using the options on the left, you can search parks by location or agency, select units or holdings to update their establishment or acquisition dates, attach notes to the map, and upload shapefiles or KMLs.
    </li>
  </ul>

    April 7, 2013 – August 25, 2013
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Opening Celebration, Sunday, April 7th, 4:00PM &#8211; 6:00PM<br /> Free event, please RSVP at <a href="http://curatingthebayopening.eventbrite.com">curatingthebayopening.eventbrite.com</a>.

  <p>
    California Historical Society is embracing 21st-century technology to celebrate the Year of the Bay in 2013, by offering its extensive collections to a crowdsourcing experiment in its gallery and at <a href="http://www.historypin.com/project/13839007-YearoftheBay/#%7Cphotos/gallery/">yearofthebay.org</a>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In a year that is bringing the high-profile America&#8217;s Cup yacht races to the Bay, the opening of a new Bay Bridge span, and the celebration of the 150th anniversary of the Port of San Francisco, the California Historical Society is staging an experimental exhibition of many items from its collections not publicly exhibited before. Many of these artifacts &#8212; photographs, paintings, and documents &#8212; present historical mysteries still to be solved. The historical society is welcoming the public into this rich collection of materials to contribute their own stories, knowledge, photographs, and other sources to create a richer, more diverse history of the San Francisco Bay.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The exhibition takes risks by asking visitors to fill in the blanks rather than presenting them with a finished narrative. It opens up the process of curating — usually reserved for trained professionals — to the public both in the exhibition and online as part of <a href="http://www.historypin.com/project/13839007-YearoftheBay/#%7Cphotos/gallery/">yearofthebay.org</a>, a dynamic crowdsourcing experiment with researchers at Stanford University and Historypin, an innovative global social technology partner.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This exhibition has been generously supported by our funding sponsors: S.D. Bechtel, Jr. Foundation, Placer Partners, Port of San Francisco, and Wells Fargo. Exhibition partners include: Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis at Stanford University, EcoCenter at Heron&#8217;s Head Park, Golden Gate Audubon, Heyday, Historypin, Literacy for Environmental Justice, Port of San Francisco, San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission, and San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park. In-kind support is being provided by: The CBW Group, Hafner Vineyard, Herglotz Public Affairs, Lagunitas Brewing Company, and Sherwin-Williams. Institutional support to CHS is provided from the Hearst Foundation, Hewlett-Packard, The James Irvine Foundation, and San Francisco Grants for the Arts.

    <id>http://localhost:4000/2012/10/22/application-deadline-extended-to-oct-26th-paid-undergraduate-research-positions-for-the-spatial-history-project</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Application deadline has been extended to 5pm, Friday Oct. 26th!</strong></p>

<p>The Spatial History Project is now accepting applications for paid undergraduate Research Assistants. We are currently hiring independent and motivated students to engage in original research and can positively impact the following research projects (please note that some positions will begin immediately this Autumn while others will begin in Winter 2013). Instructions for applying follow the project descriptions. Pay rate is $15 per hour.</p>

<p><strong>Enchanting the Desert</strong></p>

<p>Enchanting the Desert uses the 1930s narrated photographic slideshows of Zion and Grand Canyon National Parks made by Henry Peabody as its launching point.  While the immediate goal of the project is to make these slideshows accessible in a multi-media, online format, one of its deeper goals is to interpret Peabody’s landscape images from the perspective of contemporary 1930s geographical theorist Richard Hartshorne.  To do this, a series of viewing options, or modes, will be constructed, each augmenting the original slideshows in ways that meaning – both from human stories and fauna population data – changes the experience of viewing the slideshows.</p>

<p>The project seeks one undergraduate Research Assistant, whose skillsets and interests should include some or most of the following:<br>
- History of photography<br>
- Historical geography of U.S. National Parks<br>
- Excellent library/archive research skills<br>
- Desire to think creatively about how to wed geographical information with photographs<br>
- Software: web design, GIS, Photoshop, Illustrator<br>
- Desire to create new online environments<br>
- Excitement for careful, close reading of slideshow narratives<br>
- Field biology (especially historical fauna survey data)<br>
- Folklore</p>

<p>Work on this project will begin at the onset of Winter Quarter 2013.</p>

<p><strong>Forming Selves</strong></p>

<p>Forming Selves: The Creation of Child Psychiatry from Red Vienna to the Third Reich and Abroad is a new project led by Prof. Edith Sheffer that traces linkages among the forerunners of child psychiatry from Vienna in the 1930s through the 1940s, outlining connections among the diaspora and those who stayed during the rise of Nazi Germany. With the advent of the Third Reich, many who were Jewish and politically opposed to the regime fled Vienna and established their own practices in England, the United States, and beyond, leading the field of child development. Meanwhile, a cohort of psychologists and psychiatrists remained in Vienna, a number of whom took leading roles in the Nazi euthanasia program, overseeing the murders of hundreds of disabled children. This research will offer an international history of a discipline that is usually examined within national networks or within discrete schools of thought, following social as well as intellectual ties in the field. It will also consider how experiences under Nazism and the Second World War may have shaped the trajectory of child psychiatry in different places, with alternate priorities such as war orphans, clinical research, and Nazi eugenics resulting in divergent approaches.</p>

<p>Forming Selves seeks one undergraduate Research Assistant to build a database of these practitioners and their professional and personal connections to one another, and subsequently create network visualizations to explore interesting and surprising connections within this community. Preferred candidates will adeptly investigate and interpret primary source documents. A strong reading knowledge of German is preferred. Experience with network graphing software like Gephi and Pajek is a plus. Candidate should list any technical skills in their application and demonstrate a strong interest in learning new tools and advancing work in the digital humanities. Work on this project will begin at the onset of Winter Quarter 2013.</p>

<p><strong>Geography of the Post</strong></p>

<p>Geography of the Post maps the growth of the United States Postal System in the late nineteenth century into a vast, continent-spanning communications network. The project explores the network on its western periphery: where it spread, how it operated, and its role in shaping the space and place of the region. Geography of the Post uses the postal system as a way to explore larger topics in American history, including community development, the character and reach of the federal government in the nineteenth century, and how flows of information tied together the social, political, and economic fabric of the West.</p>

<p>Geography of the Post seeks one undergraduate Research Assistant for the Autumn and Winter Quarters (with possible extension into the spring and summer) to help map the U.S. Post. The RA will first use historical documents to compile a database of offices, postmasters, and carrier routes. They will then analyze locations, people, and connections in order to map the contours of the system. The RA will use a wide variety of technical tools: database creation and management, geospatial analysis using ArcGIS, network applications such as Gephi, and data visualization through Processing and Adobe Creative Suite. Prior training is not required, but candidates should include any technical expertise in their application and must demonstrate interest in history or other relevant fields such as geography, political science, economics, sociology, or communications. Work on this project will begin immediately.</p>

<p><strong>The Forma Urbis Romae Project</strong></p>

<p>In 1901, Rodolfo Lanciani produced a cartographic masterpiece that still remains the most comprehensive map of the archeological history of any city in the world. The Forma Urbis Romae is an extremely accurate map, produced on 46 plates and measuring a massive 25 ft across when fully assembled. Using an innovative graphical system of layers and linked data (much like a modern GIS), the map simultaneously captures several epoch’s of Rome’s urban fabric over a 2,000 year period. The Lanciani map is the definitive archeological reference for Rome even though it is some 110 years out of date.</p>

<p>Our research intends to critically examine, update and republish the map as an interactive website and mobile app that will also serve as a way to experience and understand Rome’s 2,000 year spatial history. The result will reveal an image of the city in a way that has never been seen in its entirety. Potential RA responsibilities are to remaster and republish the Lanciani map in digital form, to document and analyze historic maps and texts to examine how Rome has evolved from antiquity to today, and to identify errors, omissions, and gaps in the 1901 map. The research offers potential inquiry into architectural history, archeological discovery, and urban morphology, among other fields. RAs may gain experience in GIS, cartographic design, Adobe Illustrator, textual analysis, Italian language, and web/mobile development and will have the freedom to explore independent research questions within the project framework.</p>

<p>Project collaborators will be located off-campus, and candidates must be able to take initiative and have strong organizational and communication skills. Work on this project will begin Winter Quarter 2013.</p>

<p>See http://nolli.uoregon.edu and http://vasi.uoregon.edu for examples of our previous work.</p>

<p><strong>The Law of the Antebellum Frontier</strong></p>

<p>Using a massive amount of U.S. Census and city atlas data, The Law of the Antebellum Frontier project is working to demonstrate the patterns of migration on the frontier, both into and out of St. Louis, of numerous sub-populations of interest, including both the free black and slave populations present during this era. As St. Louis was considered a &#8220;staging area&#8221; for those who were travelling further west, it is essential that this critical city of the frontier is mapped with greater detail than ever before.</p>

<p>The Law of the Antebellum Frontier seeks one undergraduate Research Assistant, to start Winter Quarter 2013 and continue through Spring Quarter (with a possible extension into summer). The Research Assistant will be responsible for building historical GIS data layers to represent St. Louis in the mid-nineteenth century, using historic map sources and census records. Tasks will include georeferencing historic maps, digitizing features in ArcGIS, and building databases. Data visualizations produced by the Research Assistant in ArcGIS, Tableau, and other software will provide new avenues for historical inquiry.</p>

<p>Experience working with GIS is not required, but a strong interest in developing new technical skills is a must. Candidates should have a demonstrated interest in history or allied fields in the social sciences. Project collaborators will be located off-campus, and candidates must be able to take initiative and have strong organizational and communication skills. Work on this project will begin Winter Quarter 2013.</p>

<p><strong>Reconstructing California Conservation History</strong></p>

<p>In an era of environmental change, it is important to assess our legacy on the landscape and to understand the efficacy of our efforts to conserve natural resources. This is a challenging task, as the information on conservation history is scattered through multiple sources, organizations, and governance levels. It is also an exciting task, as the data assembled through this project will provide us with the means to assess the relative success of our conservation actions. We have been working on this project for a almost a year now, and several directions have been taken that include: changes in land cover and climate and how they relate to land acquisition; analysis of biodiversity and open space acquisition; analysis of transportation and urban development and its relation with open space acquisition; and analysis of redwood logging and its relationship with park establishment and carbon stocks.</p>

<p>Moving forward, the project seeks a motivated and independent Research Assistant to: (1) aid in the larger project and investigate the acquisition and establishment dates of open space properties throughout California; and (2) develop an independent project that looks into the economics of conservation land acquisition. This entails (1) researching open space properties acquisition (typically online), (2) contacting managing agencies to request information via email and phone, (3) learning GIS, and (4) data entry and analysis within a GIS framework. The Research Assistant will see their work integrated into a larger state-wide effort to answer important questions on the effectiveness of protected areas to preserve natural resources in California. Work will begin immediately.</p>

<p><strong>Western Railroads</strong></p>

<p>Western Railroads is a new project that augments and builds on the ongoing research of Richard White by tapping into the collective knowledge of railroad enthusiasts and local historians. An interactive website developed in partnership with an established web development firm will make a large collection of historic photographs depicting railroads available to the railroad enthusiast community for keyword tagging/textual description and placement on a webmap. Additionally, the website will feature historic maps from the David Rumsey collection, and ask participants to mark key map features&#8211;digitizing those features in a way that makes them usable for both the enthusiast and scholarly communities.</p>

<p>The undergraduate Research Assistant will help get this effort off the ground by spearheading an outreach effort with railroad enthusiast communities and local historical societies; organize content for the site as necessary, including using GIS to place (geo-rectify) historic maps in digital coordinate space; and develop concepts and mock-ups for the web interface. Preliminary site designs developed by the Research Assistant will help answer such questions as: what sorts of features will users be asked to identify, and how will this data be recorded; what features should be included in the interface; and how can the site award helpful contributors and build community amongst rail enthusiasts and scholars?</p>

<p>Preferred candidates will have a a theoretical/conceptual interest and some background in social media, website development, and game design. Candidates with an interest in environmental history, U.S. history, human-environment relations, and related social science disciplines are encouraged to apply. Experience with web technologies (HTML 5, CSS, JavaScript) is a definite plus, but not required, as is an interest in learning geographic information systems (GIS) and information visualization software like Tableau. We seek organized self-starters who can make a commitment to work through the academic year. The position is only open to current Stanford undergraduate students and will begin immediately.</p>

<p><strong>Year of the Bay</strong></p>

<p>Year of the Bay is a new project that seeks to enrich environmental history research on the San Francisco Bay Area, deriving information contained in photographs, art, maps and other sources, by directly engaging the public — or crowdsourcing local knowledge. The project will work with an established web development firm to make a formidable digital collection of photographs, art, maps and other materials available to the public in the form of an interactive interface that allows users to geo-tag and contextualize primary source materials and add their own historical materials to an online archive.</p>

<p>The undergraduate Research Assistant will help develop materials and concepts in this project&#8217;s early stages; reach out to local historical societies, museums, libraries, and community organizations; help organize and participate in events online and in real life to encourage community engagement in the project; help organize historical materials to be placed on the site; and analyze the results of the crowdsourcing, developing and testing hypotheses regarding different crowdsourcing outcomes achieved through a variety of user interfaces, including game-like structures for public participation.</p>

<p>Preferred candidates will have a theoretical/conceptual interest and some background in social media, website development, and game design. Also important is an interest in environmental history and the use of maps, photographs, and other primary source documents. Technical proficiency in website design (HTML 5, CSS, JavaScript) and web mapping (OpenLayers, Google Maps API) is a plus, but not required. The Research Assistant will collaborate with researchers located off campus, and will be independently motivated and well organized, with excellent communication skills. The position is only open to current Stanford undergraduate students and will begin immediately.</p>

<p><strong>TO APPLY</strong><br>
Current Stanford undergraduate students are eligible to apply, including those who qualify for Federal Work Study funding. Pay rate is $15 per hour. Please note that Stanford restricts the total number of hours worked by each student during any one quarter to ten.
