CESTA's Graduate Research Fellows Program is designed to prepare graduate students for a future where digital scholarship is the norm. In the program, advanced graduate students have access to a co-working environment and a community of practice in which to design, develop, and workshop digital research projects.

Intellectual exchange is fostered in a context intimate enough for social interactions to emerge. The Fellows are an integral part of the CESTA community, benefiting from cross-fertilization with the Spatial History Lab, the Literary Lab, Humanities + Design, and a wide range of other project work going on at CESTA. The cohort meets weekly at CESTA to learn from experts and share experiences with each other around digital research methods and digital humanities pedagogy. Activities include skills workshops, invited speakers, and group readings on current topics in the digital humanities. Fellows will also have opportunities to present their own work in progress for review.

### The Laboratory Environment

The laboratory environment at CESTA provides access to both digital and analog technologies in a setting that is conducive to work with data. The flexible configuration of the laboratory supports a range of activities: small group problem-solving, ad-hoc presentations, distance collaboration, and individual work. The Center is a hub for sustained research activity where faculty, staff, graduate students and undergraduate students can comingle. It is a place to work through problems together and ask for feedback from each other.

### Learning the Basics

Fellows will learn how to manage data with versioning software and how to transform data for use with a range of different software tools. They will also be exposed to the theoretical underpinnings and methodological approaches to visualizing information. The fellows will learn laboratory practices including maintaining a record of experiments, regularly reviewing work with their peers and taking a project from initial concept through to publishable work.

### Developing Research and Learning Advanced Techniques

Graduate fellows can bring their own research projects or work in collaboration with faculty. We cultivate intellectual engagement with presentations of work in progress and periodic workshops bringing in scholars from partner research centers outside of Stanford. The program fosters an understanding of technology and its influence in the construction of meaning, giving students the tools to problematize data structures and visual models of data.
